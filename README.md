Here are some ideas to get you started:

Data Source:

You'll need data on Pokémon! There are several publicly available datasets online that contain details on each Pokémon. Here are a few resources:
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon
PokéAPI: https://pokeapi.co/ (This provides an API to access data, you might need to write some code to format it for Power BI)
Pokemon database : https://pokemondb.net/ (I Used this dataset)
Possible Visualizations:

Pokémon by Type: Use a pie chart or donut chart to show the distribution of Pokémon by their primary type (Fire, Water, Grass, etc.). You could even segment this further to show dual-type Pokémon.
Legendary vs. Mythical: Create a stacked bar chart to compare the number of Legendary Pokémon to Mythical Pokémon.
Average Stats by Generation: Line charts can show the average stats (HP, Attack, etc.) for all Pokémon introduced in each generation (Gen 1, Gen 2, etc.).
Pokémon by Region: A world map with custom visuals can represent the number or type of Pokémon found in each region (Kanto, Johto, etc.).
Scatter Plot: Explore the relationship between different stats, like Attack vs. Special Attack, using a scatter plot with color-coding for type.
Slicer for Specific Exploration: Add a slicer to allow users to filter the data by type, generation, or other criteria.
Additional Features:

Pokémon Card Images: Include an image of each Pokémon card alongside the data visualizations for a more visually appealing experience.
Drill-Down Functionality: Allow users to click on a specific data point (e.g., a Pokémon name) to see a detailed view of that Pokémon's stats, evolution chain, and bio.
